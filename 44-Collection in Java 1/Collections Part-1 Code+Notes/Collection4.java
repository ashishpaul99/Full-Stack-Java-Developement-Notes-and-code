//Important Question

//->1Q. After these classes is array concept is gone or outdated.
//Ans- No

//->When we have to store Large data we can go with Arrays or Collection(ArrayList, LinkedList..)

//2Q-when to use Array over ArrayList?
//A- whenever size of the data is known to you and if you are sure 
//that data or information is homogenous or similar type then you 
//must go with array.

//->Array is faster than ArrayList. 
//->ArrayList is collection. it store as object. 
//->internally primitive data is converted into object in ArrayList.
//->for object memory  has to be created and it has to be stored.
//-> new instance has to be created and then the data will be 
//  stored.
//->In Array we can store primitive data and object data.
//->Array is object but we inside it is primitive.
//->Array is faster than than ArrayList.
//->internally in ArrayList Autoboxing will happen.
