//->1. Multi-Tasking-> Doing many tasks at a time or      
//  Doing many tasks simultaneously.
//->Executing several task simultaneously is the concept of 
//  multi-tasking.
//->See picture 30:00


//1.1 There are 2 types of Multitasking.
//Multi tasking is categorized into two types.
//1. Process Based Multi-tasking
//2. Thread Based Multi-tasking


//1. Process Based Multi-tasking
//Executing several tasks simultaneously where each task is 
//a separate independent process such type of multitasking is 
//called "process based multitasking".
//eg:
//	 typing a java program
//	 listening to a song
//	 downloading the file from Internet 

//->Process based multitasking is best suited at "os level".
//->Switching from one process to another process it under the 
//  Control of operating system.
//->that switching is called as Context Switching.
//   asking OS to open programs.
//->Operation System plays vital role.
//->As a user we can navigate form one application to other 
//  one.
//->these multiple tasks are run on RAM with help of OS.

//Process-1->Edit plus
//Process-2->YouTube
//Process-3->mp3

//=>1.2 Context Switching - switching from another process to 
//other process and make sure user is not disturbed using 
//application. 
//->That mechanism we call it as Context switching.
//->while switching OS will face little bit burden.
//->So many things happened on the RAM while switching.
//->when context switching is been done hardware units or
//  devices comes into picture.
//->Context switching is heavy weight action.
//=>1.3 Heavy Weight-Mores burden on OS. this may result in 
//  system. 
//->due to RAM space management some times system becomes 
//  slow and system may get hang.
//->OS level multi tasking-independent tasks contolled by OS.
